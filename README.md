## Project building

Before starting, you'll need [Node](https://nodejs.org/en)
 (which includes NPM), [Shopify CLI](https://shopify.dev/docs/themes/tools/cli/install) and [Gulp](https://shopify.dev/docs/themes/tools/cli)

To start a local development environment, use:

```bash
  gulp sass:watch
```

This will process any Sass (SCSS) files and launch a project showing the current files. Making changes to the files should result in the page updating automatically.

```bash
  shopify theme dev -s=test-refactor
```

This will launch a local development environment using the Shopify CLI
